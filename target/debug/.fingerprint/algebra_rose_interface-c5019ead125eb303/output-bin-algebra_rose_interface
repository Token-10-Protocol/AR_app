{"$message_type":"diagnostic","message":"use of partially moved value: `cli.command`","code":{"code":"E0382","explanation":"A variable was used after its contents have been moved elsewhere.\n\nErroneous code example:\n\n```compile_fail,E0382\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = MyStruct{ s: 5u32 };\n    let y = x;\n    x.s = 6;\n    println!(\"{}\", x.s);\n}\n```\n\nSince `MyStruct` is a type that is not marked `Copy`, the data gets moved out\nof `x` when we set `y`. This is fundamental to Rust's ownership system: outside\nof workarounds like `Rc`, a value cannot be owned by more than one variable.\n\nSometimes we don't need to move the value. Using a reference, we can let another\nfunction borrow the value without changing its ownership. In the example below,\nwe don't actually have to move our string to `calculate_length`, we can give it\na reference to it with `&` instead.\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let s1 = String::from(\"hello\");\n\n    let len = calculate_length(&s1);\n\n    println!(\"The length of '{}' is {}.\", s1, len);\n}\n\nfn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {\n    s.len()\n}\n```\n\nA mutable reference can be created with `&mut`.\n\nSometimes we don't want a reference, but a duplicate. All types marked `Clone`\ncan be duplicated by calling `.clone()`. Subsequent changes to a clone do not\naffect the original variable.\n\nMost types in the standard library are marked `Clone`. The example below\ndemonstrates using `clone()` on a string. `s1` is first set to \"many\", and then\ncopied to `s2`. Then the first character of `s1` is removed, without affecting\n`s2`. \"any many\" is printed to the console.\n\n```\nfn main() {\n    let mut s1 = String::from(\"many\");\n    let s2 = s1.clone();\n    s1.remove(0);\n    println!(\"{} {}\", s1, s2);\n}\n```\n\nIf we control the definition of a type, we can implement `Clone` on it ourselves\nwith `#[derive(Clone)]`.\n\nSome types have no ownership semantics at all and are trivial to duplicate. An\nexample is `i32` and the other number types. We don't have to call `.clone()` to\nclone them, because they are marked `Copy` in addition to `Clone`. Implicit\ncloning is more convenient in this case. We can mark our own types `Copy` if\nall their members also are marked `Copy`.\n\nIn the example below, we implement a `Point` type. Because it only stores two\nintegers, we opt-out of ownership semantics with `Copy`. Then we can\n`let p2 = p1` without `p1` being moved.\n\n```\n#[derive(Copy, Clone)]\nstruct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut p1 = Point{ x: -1, y: 2 };\n    let p2 = p1;\n    p1.x = 1;\n    println!(\"p1: {}, {}\", p1.x, p1.y);\n    println!(\"p2: {}, {}\", p2.x, p2.y);\n}\n```\n\nAlternatively, if we don't control the struct's definition, or mutable shared\nownership is truly required, we can use `Rc` and `RefCell`:\n\n```\nuse std::cell::RefCell;\nuse std::rc::Rc;\n\nstruct MyStruct { s: u32 }\n\nfn main() {\n    let mut x = Rc::new(RefCell::new(MyStruct{ s: 5u32 }));\n    let y = x.clone();\n    x.borrow_mut().s = 6;\n    println!(\"{}\", x.borrow().s);\n}\n```\n\nWith this approach, x and y share ownership of the data via the `Rc` (reference\ncount type). `RefCell` essentially performs runtime borrow checking: ensuring\nthat at most one writer or multiple readers can access the data at any one time.\n\nIf you wish to learn more about ownership in Rust, start with the\n[Understanding Ownership][understanding-ownership] chapter in the Book.\n\n[understanding-ownership]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html\n"},"level":"error","spans":[{"file_name":"INTERFACE/src/main.rs","byte_start":17407,"byte_end":17412,"line_start":438,"line_end":438,"column_start":27,"column_end":32,"is_primary":false,"text":[{"text":"        Commands::Login { token } => {","highlight_start":27,"highlight_end":32}],"label":"value partially moved here","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null},{"file_name":"INTERFACE/src/main.rs","byte_start":19666,"byte_end":19677,"line_start":504,"line_end":504,"column_start":18,"column_end":29,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"    if !matches!(cli.command, Commands::Exit) {","highlight_start":18,"highlight_end":29}],"label":"value used here after partial move","suggested_replacement":null,"suggestion_applicability":null,"expansion":null}],"children":[{"message":"partial move occurs because value has type `Option<std::string::String>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait","code":null,"level":"note","spans":[],"children":[],"rendered":null},{"message":"borrow this binding in the pattern to avoid moving the value","code":null,"level":"help","spans":[{"file_name":"INTERFACE/src/main.rs","byte_start":17407,"byte_end":17407,"line_start":438,"line_end":438,"column_start":27,"column_end":27,"is_primary":true,"text":[{"text":"        Commands::Login { token } => {","highlight_start":27,"highlight_end":27}],"label":null,"suggested_replacement":"ref ","suggestion_applicability":"MachineApplicable","expansion":null}],"children":[],"rendered":null}],"rendered":"\u001b[1m\u001b[91merror[E0382]\u001b[0m\u001b[1m: use of partially moved value: `cli.command`\u001b[0m\n   \u001b[1m\u001b[94m--> \u001b[0mINTERFACE/src/main.rs:504:18\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m438\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m         Commands::Login { token } => {\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                           \u001b[1m\u001b[94m-----\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94mvalue partially moved here\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m...\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m504\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m     if !matches!(cli.command, Commands::Exit) {\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                  \u001b[1m\u001b[91m^^^^^^^^^^^\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[91mvalue used here after partial move\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m= \u001b[0m\u001b[1mnote\u001b[0m: partial move occurs because value has type `Option<std::string::String>`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait\n\u001b[1m\u001b[96mhelp\u001b[0m: borrow this binding in the pattern to avoid moving the value\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m\n\u001b[1m\u001b[94m438\u001b[0m \u001b[1m\u001b[94m| \u001b[0m        Commands::Login { \u001b[92mref \u001b[0mtoken } => {\n    \u001b[1m\u001b[94m|\u001b[0m                           \u001b[92m+++\u001b[0m\n\n"}
